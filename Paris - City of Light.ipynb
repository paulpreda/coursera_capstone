Around, the \"Ile de France\" region is the biggest european region in terms of population and GDP. Real estate is quite expensive, and there are important discrepancies among the 20 Paris districts (\"Arrondissements\") and the cities which are very close to Paris.\n\nOur project will focus on East Paris (10 arrondissements) and 10 surrounding cities close to East Paris. Data collection and interpretation will focus on two distinct parts:\n- first, we will examine the **real estate** price per \"Arrondissement\" or city, based on the available public data of Real Estate transactions. We will calculate the average price per square meter per city.\n- second, we will find the most **popular venues** and segment the neighborhoods according to the typology of their venues. Of course, Foursquera will be used to collect the associated data.\n\nOnce we have the Real Estate prices associated to each Quartier and the Venues profile, we will try to find a **correlation** between the two types of data and describe what is the **venue segment associated with a \"expensive\", \"medium\" and \"low price\" neighborhood**.\n\nWe will than use then our data science powers to make some recommendation for the Mayor in order to adjust the City Policies. Particularly, we will try to find **what kind of venues** should be encouraged in order to increase the **attractiveness of the low price neighborhoods**."
